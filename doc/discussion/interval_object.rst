 Interval object
=================

Intervals can carry particular special meaning in the analysis of
time-series. For example, a typical case, is when two time-series are recorded
simultaneously. One is recorded from measurement of some continuous
physilogical variable, such as fMRI BOLD (and is represented by a an object of
type :ref:`UniformTimeSeries`). The other is a series of discrete events
occurring concurrently (and can be represented by a :ref:`EventSeries` or by a
:ref:`NonUniformTimeSeries`). For example, button presses by the subject, or
trials of different kinds. If we want to analyze the progression of the
physiological time-series, locked to particular kinds of events in the
event-series, we would need a notion of an interval of time surrounding those
events.


In order to do that, we propose implementing a :class:`TimeInterval`
object.

.. _interval_attributes:

Attributes
----------

A :class:`TimeInterval` object can be thought of as a :class:`Slice` for
time-series objects and therefore should at least implement all attributes and
methods of the slice object (sub-classing of slice doesn't seem to be possible,
see :ref:`interval_from_slice`).

In particular, an object of class :class:`TimeInterval`, :attr:`TI`, has
the attributes/functions:

* :attr:`TI.t_start`: the start time of the interval.
* :attr:`TI.t_stop`: the end time of the interval.
* :attr:`TI.duration`: the duration of the interval.

Obviously, knowledge of two of these, should allow calculation of the
third. Therefore, this should be implemented in the object with a
:func:`setattr_on_read` decoration and the object should inherit
:class:`ResetMixin`.  Initialization of the object would
verify that enough information exists and that the information provided is
consistent, in the same manner that is already implemented in
:class:`UniformTimeSeries`.  

* :attr:`TI.t_step`: originally, we thought that this could be abused to
  represent a time offset, relative to the attributes :attr:`t_start` and
  :attr:`t_stop`. That is, it can tell us where relative to these two
  time-points some interesting even, which this interval surrounds, or this
  interval is close to, occurs. This can be used in order to interpert how
  time-series access is done using the :class:`TimeInterval` object. See
  :ref:`time_series_access`. This attribute can be implemented as an optional
  input on initialization, such that it defaults to be equal to
  :attr:`t_start`.

* :func:`TI.indices(len)`: this method returns a tuple of time points that can
  be used for slicing. Originally, this is meant to produce a list of indices
  of length len that can be directly used to obtain a slice of the same
  length. However, when we use a :class:`TimeInterval` for slicing, we don't
  know yet, how long the sliced object will be (it depends on the sampling
  interval of the sliced object). If we just use len=0, the indices method just
  returns a 3-tuple that still contains all necessary information and can be
  used for slicing:

.. code-block:: python

   >>>TI.indices(0)
   (TI.t_start TI.t_stop, TI.t_step)

.. _interval_initialization:

Initialization
--------------

There are various different ways to initialize a :class:`TimeInterval`:

* With two time points t_start and t_stop, both of :class:`TimeArray`:

.. code-block:: python

       TimeInterval(t_start=t1,t_stop=t2)

* With a time point :attr:`t_start` (a :class:`TimeArray`) and a duration (a
  :class:`TimeArray`):

.. code-block:: python

       TimeInterval(t_start=t1,duration=t_duration) 
 
* With an optional third argument :attr:`t_step`  (a :class:`TimeArray`)
  indicating a time offset of a time point $t_0=t_{start}-t_{step}$ relative to
  which the time inside the interval should be interpreted. The relevance of
  this third argument will become clearer when the time interval is used to
  slice into a time-series object (see :ref:`time_series_access`). Briefly -
  the returned object would be a time-series object with the :attr:`t0`
  attribute set to be the $t_0$ described above. If not provided, this would
  default to be equal to :attr:`t_start`:

.. code-block:: python

   TimeInterval(t_start=t1, t_stop=t2, t_step=delta_t)

or

.. code-block:: python

   TimeInterval (t_start=t1,duration=delta_t1, t_step=delta_t2)
  
Finally, we would like allow setting the interval with floating point values,
which will be interpreted as time points :attr:`t_start` and
:attr:`t_stop`. This convention would be convenient, but requires that the
initialization of the object will know what the units are. In order to make
this possible, the interval (similar to the current implementation of the
time-series object will have an attribute :attr:`t_unit`, which would default
to 's'. The initialization will then cast the values provided into the
appropriate :class:`TimeArray` objects.

.. _interval_from_slice:
Implementation using a slice object
-----------------------------------

Sub-classing of the slice object doesn't seem to be possible:

  >>> class myslice(slice):
  ...     pass
  ... 
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<ipython console>", line 1, in <module>
  TypeError: Error when calling the metaclass bases
      type 'slice' is not an acceptable base type

However, it seems that a (scalar) :class:`TimeInterval` can be implemented
using a slice object, provided the time points :attr:`t_start` and
:attr:`t_stop` and the time offset :attr:`t_step` implement an __index__
method:

  >>> s = slice('t_start','t_stop','t_step')
  >>> s.start
  't_start'
  >>> s.stop
  't_stop'
  >>> s.step
  't_step'
  >>> s.indices(1)
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<ipython console>", line 1, in <module>
  TypeError: slice indices must be integers or None or have an __index__ method

Alternatively, the :class:`TimeInterval` can be implemented as an original
object with the default constructor as similar as possible to the constructor
of the slice object, so that we can use slice-like operations, but still
maintain slice algebra and such.

In addition to the possibility of algebraic operations, there are other reasons
to have the :class:`TimeInterval` be an original class that holds a slice
object that can be returned by the method :func:`TI.asslice()`.

.. _interval_arrays:

Interval arrays
---------------

In addition to scalar :class:`TimeInterval` objects, it also makes sense to
define arrays of :class:`TimeInterval` objects. These arrays can be implemented
as :class:`np.ndarray`, with an :class:`object` dtype.
